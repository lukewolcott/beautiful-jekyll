Hello! I earned my PhD in algebraic topology from the University of Washington in 2012. Since then I’ve worked as a research postdoc, a visiting assistant professor, a full-time lecturer, and a data scientist. I’m currently based in Seattle, WA, and work as a data scientist at a healthcare tech company called Edifecs.  The purpose of this website is mainly to exhibit some early data science projects, which I used to teach myself the tools of the trade.

My academic research was in applied topology, in the area of topological data analysis. This field tries to use the flexibility of topology and our intuition of space to understand the “shape of data”.  I also collaborated extensively on many interdisciplinary projects (ecology, phenomenology, art), and was Lead Editor for an informal journal of alternative mathematical exposition. Read more about my academic career at [my math website](http://www.forthelukeofmath.com).

I pivoted from academia to data science over the last four years. I worked through (and scored well on) many online courses, including the complete Johns Hopkins University Coursera specialization in Data Science, the Stanford Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng, and his Deep Learning Specialization, too. But I’ve also worked hard to build my coding and DS skills on a range of specific projects, showcased on this portfolio website.

On a personal note, one of my motivations for transitioning from academia to industry two years ago was a desire to help make the world a better place, faster. I’ve traveled to over 75 countries and spent over 5 years living, working, and volunteering abroad. As a math professor, I worked to make my classrooms and pedagogy centered on principles of equity and inclusion. As a data scientist as Edifecs, I hold our team to high standards and promote conversations on due diligence and ethics.  My hope is that I can use data to help people.
