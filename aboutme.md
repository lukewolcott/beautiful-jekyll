Hello!  I earned my PhD in algebraic topology from the University of Washington in 2012.  Since then I've worked as a research postdoc, a visiting assistant professor, a full-time lecturer, and a mathematical consultant.  I'm currently based in Los Angeles, CA, teaching at the University of Southern California.  [Here's my math website.](http://www.forthelukeofmath.com)

My research is now in applied topology, in the area of topological data analysis.  This field tries to use the flexibility of topology and our intuition of space to understand the "shape of data".

For the last two years I've been pivoting to data science. I've taken and scored well on many online courses (including the complete Johns Hopkins University Coursera specialization in Data Science, and the Stanford Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng).  But I've also worked hard to build my coding and DS skills on a range of projects.  The purpose of this website is to exhibit some of those projects.

On a personal note, one of my motivations for transitioning from academia to industry is a desire to help make the world a better place, faster.  I've traveled to over 65 countries and spent over 5 years living, working, and volunteering abroad.  As a math professor, I've worked to make my classrooms and pedagogy centered on principles of equity and inclusion.  My hope is that I can find a way to use data to help people.
