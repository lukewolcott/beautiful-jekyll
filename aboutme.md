Hello! I earned my PhD in algebraic topology from the University of Washington in 2012. Since then I’ve worked as a research postdoc, a visiting assistant professor, a full-time lecturer, and a data scientist. I’m currently based in Seattle, WA.

My academic research was in applied topology, in the area of topological data analysis. This field tries to use the flexibility of topology and our intuition of space to understand the “shape of data”.  I also collaborated extensively on many interdisciplinary projects (ecology, phenomenology, art), and was Head Editor for an informal journal of alternative mathematical exposition; [read more at my math website](http://www.forthelukeofmath.com).

I pivoted from academia to data science over the last two years. I worked through (and scored well on) many online courses, including the complete Johns Hopkins University Coursera specialization in Data Science, and the Stanford Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng. But I’ve also worked hard to build my coding and DS skills on a range of specific projects.  Each runs through the full DS pipeline, from asking a question to communicating a result, but they all dive deep into different stages. The purpose of this website is to exhibit some of these projects.

On a personal note, one of my motivations for transitioning from academia to industry was a desire to help make the world a better place, faster. I’ve traveled to over 70 countries and spent over 5 years living, working, and volunteering abroad. As a math professor, I worked to make my classrooms and pedagogy centered on principles of equity and inclusion. My hope is that I can find a way to use data to help people.
