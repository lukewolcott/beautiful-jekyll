title: Interactive JavaPlexDemo with Barcodes
---

I wrote a Processing sketch to help demo and build intuition about how
topological data analysis works (in two dimensions).  It builds on the
javaplexDemo.pde written by Mikael Vejdemo-Johansson.  You can add and
remove data points and see the persistent homology barcode generated
and plotted in real-time.  You can save datasets and barcodes, to
compare them.  It provides a nice way to visualize the filtration
parameter.

To see screenshots and a screencast, [check out this page](http://forthelukeofmath.com/InteractiveJPDwB/screenshots.html).  The GitHub
repo for the project is [here](https://github.com/lukewolcott/InteractiveJPDwB).
