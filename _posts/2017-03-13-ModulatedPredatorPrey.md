title: Modulated Predator-Prey Dynamics
---

In a famous 2000 Science article, "Crossing the Hopf Bifurcation in a
Live Predator-Prey System", Fussmann et. al. measure the population
dynamics of a predator-prey system modulated by a third parameter.  In
this ongoing project, I conjecture that this dataset has interesting
topology that can be detected using topological data analysis.

Prof Fussmann has generously shared his data, and I've begun initial
exploratory data analysis.  You can read a [short report on this
analysis](https://lukewolcott.github.io/ModulatedPredatorPrey/ExploratoryDataAnalysis.html),
explore the data yourself with this [nifty Shiny
app](https://lukewolcott.shinyapps.io/PredPreyCycleByRestrictingDays/)
I created, or read more at this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lukewolcott/ModulatedPredatorPrey).
