title: 20 weeks of civic data analyses
subtitle: Working weekly end-to-end through DS pipeline, for good
---

Each week for 20 weeks I worked through the data science pipeline with
an interesting culturally/politically-relevant dataset, usually
inspired by the news.  Pose a question; find a dataset; clean it up;
explore it to get a feel; build a ML model, or perform a statistical
inference, or generate nice plots, or create an interactive Shiny app;
communicate with a short report.  The goal was to be quick and
relevant.  The project GitHub repo provides summaries, links to
reports, and tags indicating which tools I used.
