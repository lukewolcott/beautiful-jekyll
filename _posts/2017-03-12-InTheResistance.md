title: In The Resistance
---

I've traveled to about 65 countries, and spent about 5 years total
living abroad.  Some of this time was spent volunteering and trying to
answer the question, "How can I help?"  Since my college years I've
maintained a passionate interest in environmental issues; in
recent years this has grown into a concern for equity and social
justice issues.  And since the recent election I've felt compelled to
participate in resisting the misinformation and misunderstanding of
the Trump administration.

Towards this end, I've challenged myself to analyze a
politically-relevant dataset each week.  Usually this amounts to a
data visualization with ggplot or a Shin app, but I've done some
hypothesis testing and run some machine learning algorithms as well.

The weekly files, with explanations, are going up at [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/lukewolcott/InTheResistance).
