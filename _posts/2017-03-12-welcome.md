This website will exhibit my data science portfolio.  My data science
projects involve machine learning on Indian population data, Shiny
apps to explore biology data, various data visualizations of
politically relevant data, and lots and lots of short reports on
topological data analysis -- finding the "shape of data".

I'm coming to data science from a solid 5-year career in teaching and
researching pure mathematics, and with a strong concern for
environmental, international, and social justice issues.  To find out
more about my mathematical life and projects, including an academic
CV, visit <www.forthelukeofmath.com>.
