subtitle: collaboration to analyze Indian health data

I've traveled to about 70 countries, and spent about 5 years total
living abroad.  Some of this time was spent volunteering and trying to
answer the question, "How can I help?"  Since my college years I've
maintained a passionate interest in environmental issues, and in
recent years this has grown into a concern for equity and social
justice issues.  This project aims to use machine learning and data science to help out.  So for 20 weeks I challenged myself to analyze a
politically-relevant dataset each week.  Some weeks this amounted to a
data visualization with ggplot or a Shiny app, and other weeks 
hypothesis testing or machine learning.

The weekly files, with explanations, are up at [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/lukewolcott/InTheResistance).
