title: Rain and water level in Lake Superior
---

One of my first projects to apply topological data analysis to real
world data, this was a collaboration in 2016 with Josh Thompson at Northern
Michigan University.  We hunted for a minimal working example of how
delayed oscillations can result in interesting topological features,
and found it in datasets on precipitation and lake water levels around
Lake Superior.
